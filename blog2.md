## Notes for Challenge Announcement Blog

>Last month, we announced the [Detroit Mapping Challenge](https://www.openstreetmap.us/2018/07/detroit-mapping-challenge-sotmus2018/),
>with a goal of making the Detroit region the best openly mapped region in the world. We've been planning and discussing the challenge
>in the DETROIT channel over on the [OSMUS Slack](https://osmus-slack.herokuapp.com/) and on [GitHub repo](https://github.com/osmus/detroit-mappng-challenge/issues)
>and we're excited to announce some ways you can particpate!

#### OSM US Task Manager

>The US Tasking manager is a fork of the popular HOTSOM Tasking Manager. It allows mappers to define tasks by uploading a geojson file
>which get gridded into managable areas for mapping. For the Detroit Mapping Challenge we created a grid of city blocks using open parcel
>data to define right of ways and centerline data to define block segements. Each task for the challenge is defined by neighborhood
>boundaries as defined by the City of Detroit. We've been testing the workflow in the [Corktown Section of Detroit](https://tasks.openstreetmap.us/project/50), and have created an [addtional set of tasks](https://tasks.openstreetmap.us/contribute?difficulty=ALL&campaign=Detroit) around the downtown area.

>Mappers that participate in the challenge will notice some new functionality in ID. For the first time,
>ID users will be able to define a Vector Tile Layer as a backround layer. This awesome new feature comes courtesy of Princi Vershwal,
>a Google Summer of Code intern at Mapbox. You can read more about the mechanics of this from the [ID Changelog](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2111) or [this blogpost](https://medium.com/@vershwal/vector-tile-support-for-openstreetmaps-id-editor-40b1cb77f63b).
>A great way to test this new feature out is veryfing City of Detroit Parks boundaries and names. Using [this] vector tile layer, an
>editor can zoom into any of the [city's 309 parks](https://data.detroitmi.gov/Fun/Parks-2016/yu9n-k8rd) and confirm the names, boundaries,
>and hopefully add a few missing ones.  
>
In addition, one of the main goals of the Detroit Mapping Challenge is to [improve the POI coverage](https://github.com/osmus/detroit-mapping-challenge/issues/8)
>in the region. This includes commercial and industrial businesses, restaraunts, and any other point of interest. Using the new ID
>Vector Tile Layer feature mentioned above, editors can add either of 2 layers created for this challenge. The first is business information
>provided by the City of Detroit. The seconds is an export of POI's from [alltheplaces.xyz](https://www.alltheplaces.xyz). Both of these
>layers have the location of the point with the business name and addresses as supporting labels. Using these in conjunction with
>Bing Streetside Imagery, OpenStreetCam, and Mapillary Street-level images, anyone can participate from around the world.

>There are many ways to participate in the Detroit Mapping Challenge and we hope you'll join us!
